Zookeeper and\r\njansson (for JSON parsing) can probably be removed from the producer since the\r\nMetadata API provides everything a producer needs.\r\n\r\nFor setting up a dev cluster on a single box, I used this as an example: [Running a Multi-Broker Apache Kafka 0.8 Cluster on a Single Node](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/13/running-a-multi-broker-apache-kafka-cluster-on-a-single-node/)\r\n\r\nI'm also documenting the wire protocol as I go along. Documentation can be found\r\nunder the docs/ directory in this repo or on http://tapestry.io/blog/kafka_wire_format.html\r\n\r\n*Warning!* This isn't ready for production yet.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I only support producer and metadata requests/responses. I provide\r\nAPIs for producing a single message to a given topic and batching multiple\r\nmessages to different topics and partitions in a single go.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
