I started this library because\r\nthere doesn't seem to be a decent Kafka library for C.\r\n\r\nLicense: 2-Clause BSD\r\n\r\nYou need the Apache ZooKeeper C library installed (zookeeper_mt).\r\n\r\nFor setting up a dev cluster on a single box, I used this as an example: [Running a Multi-Broker Apache Kafka 0.8 Cluster on a Single Node](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/13/running-a-multi-broker-apache-kafka-cluster-on-a-single-node/)\r\n\r\nI'm also documenting the wire protocol as I go along. Documentation can be found\r\nunder the docs/ directory in this repo.\r\n\r\n*Warning!* This isn't ready for primetime yet unless you're feeling adventurous.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
